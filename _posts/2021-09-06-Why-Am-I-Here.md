# Why I Am Here?
I've pretty much wanted to be a software developer all my adult life. I suppose it's a combination of life happening and me not being able to consistantly put in the work to become one (or more accurately too lazy). It has been an on and off thing for many, many years.

Last month, I decided to dabble in Ethical Hacking last month. I do a bit of studying and come across the Twilio program and try unsuccessfully to hack the platform. Their SendGrid product catches my eye and this could be a solution for a pain point as a real estate agent. At the end of each month, I need to send a bunch of emails to our landlords with individual attachments which your standard mail merge will not support. So I spent a weekend and built a program in Node. It takes data from a spreadsheet and sends customized emails with individual attachments using the SendGrid platform.

I created value for myself and I think that is the power of software.

Thinking abstractly, if I was to present a solution or multiple solutions to a customer, what is the value proposition that I am presenting? Where is the value coming from? Am I saving them time and/or money?

## What Am I Doing Now?
This past week, I have been working on a property management software project. I don't intend on commercializing this, I just thought it would be a really good project for a portfolio where I get to build something bigger than anything that I have ever built and where I get to use some of my domain knowledge as someone in this industry.

It's clear to me that are a lot of gaps in my knowledge and I'm no where near where I need to be as a developer. Frankly, this project was a bit too ambitious for my current skillset. So I'm going to put this project on hold for a while and work on a few smaller projects. 

I got a lot of work ahead of me.
